<p>The 5G core network is developed by III designed for service based architecture (SBA) and follows 3GPP Standard R15. The III-5GC implements the 5G components as standalone(SA) architecture as container-based with C/U split architecture. All the modules can be deployed on virtual machines on top of a large number of virtualization environments. For different types of use cases, we launched two kinds of 5GC products for basic and professional versions.
All the launched functions are verified by spirent landslide.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/III-5GC/III-5GC-Free-Trial">Download Now</a></p>
<p>The basic III-5GC is a free trial for lab research, prototype product testing and simple 5G end-to-end demonstration purpose only. It contains the 5G core essential components like AMF, SMF, UPF for supporting 5G procedures like UE registration, PDU session establishment, and service request. The III 5GC-Basic can be deployed with docker containers and can run on top of common hardware platforms with any server or even a laptop in Laboratory or Campus.</p>

<a id="iii-5gc---professional" class="anchor" href="#iii-5gc---professional" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>III 5GC - Professional</h3>
<p>Our leading product is the professional 5G Core for enterprise and private network scenarios. In the professional version, we especially focus on data plane efficiency and system reliability. Thus, we develop both software and hardware solutions for data plane to enhance packet processing and load monitoring. By this way, the throughput can achieve to 10Gbps and to keep the data plane latency less than 1ms. For various environment enterprises use cases, III 5GC-Professional also support interworking with MEC and local breakout applications.</p>

<a id="in-the-future" class="anchor" href="#in-the-future" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In the future</h3>
<p>We keep following the 3GPP Standard to provide more 5G vertical use cases. For 2021, we focus on smart factory and industry I4.0 applications, and provide greater data throughput and latency improvements. Furthermore, to achieve the enterprise service requirement, we aim to build Fault Tolerance and advance OAM system for maintaining and monitoring the network system. Moreover, we plan to develop the vertical use cases like Multicast Broadcast Service(MBS) and Network Automation(NA) which are 3GPP R17 key work items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Development Roadmap :
<ul>
<li>2020 Q4 : URLLC application / MEC interworking</li>
<li>2021 : IIoT TSN / Fault Tolerance / High Availability</li>
<li>2022 : Cloud Native / Network Slicing / non-3GPP Access</li>
<li>2023 : Multicast Broadcast Service / Network Automation / Security enhancement
